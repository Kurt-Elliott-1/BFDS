                                 The premise behind this program is simple,
                                 everyone has their favorite archiving program
                                 and I thought it was about time that there
                                 was a conversion program that would handle
                                 them all and any future archivers that may
                                 come along.

                                 CDD 1.1 - an improved Change Directory
                                 command that sets the errorlevel.
                                 The CD command that comes with MS or PC DOS
                                 has four flaws:
                                 1. It does not set the ERRORLEVEL for
                                 Invalid directories.
                                 2. It fails when there is a trailing
                                 backslash on the name.
                                 3. You cannot hide its error messages with
                                 >NUL: redirection.
                                 4. It will not change the drive for you, just
                                 the directory.
                                 CDD acts just like CD except that it fixes
                                 these four problems. CDD is slower since it
                                 is must be loaded each time, whereas CD is
                                 internal to DOS.

                                 CRITTER Version 1.32
                                 A TSR replacement Critical Error Handler
                                 CRITTER is a full-featured replacement for
                                 the DOS critical error handler. CRITTER uses
                                 a pop-up window that does not change the
                                 displayed program, and provides many options
                                 that DOS does not have. All errors can be
                                 logged to a printer. CRITTER can use
                                 automatic responses to an error, with a
                                 variable time delay. With this version of
                                 CRITTER, a "response pattern" can be used to
                                 behave in a predictable manner, such as "retry
                                 three times then fail".
                                 CRITTER was originally written to handle normal
                                 critical errors with more aplomb than DOS.
                                 It seemed that most programs back then did
                                 not have their own critical error handlers, so
                                 any error would ruin some of the application's
                                 display. To this day, many commercial
                                 applications ignore critical errors.

                                 'Fill' will copy all your files, filling up
                                 each floppy disk. To do this, 'Fill' will
                                 build a list of the files of the directory,
                                 sort this list by size order and then copy
                                 the biggest file to the floppy. Second, it
                                 will copy the biggest file that can be copied
                                 in the remaining space of the floppy and so
                                 on. When the first floppy will be filled up,
                                 'Fill' will prompt you for another disk until
                                 the directory is completely copied to
                                 floppies.

                                 FIXSHIFT.COM a program that corrects a
                                 keyboard problem occurring in Microsoft
                                 QBasic on certain computers (COMPAQ),
                                 (Tandy), (Toshiba), and others that have an
                                 earlier ROM BIOS. The keyboard problem occurs
                                 on these systems if their keyboards include a
                                 cursor pad that is separate from the numeric
                                 keypad. On this type of system, the keyboard
                                 may not perform the proper cursor movements
                                 within QBasic when the NUM LOCK key is turned
                                 on. FixShift corrects this problem by
                                 remapping the cursor keypad so that the arrow
                                 keys will function properly.

                                 *.BAK. The command "DEL *.BAK" would be

                                 Hbreak is an utility capable of aborting the

                                 computer crashes. The only caution is not to
                                 invoke it in the middle of another TSR
                                 execution (vg. SideKick). It is not
                                 recomended to use it while DOS PRINT is
                                 working. HBREAK is very powerful. Ctrl-Break

                                 HEXED V1.52 is a powerful binary file
                                 editor/ viewer. It includes a number of
                                 useful features and supports a wide variety
                                 of file formats (GIF, PCX, MOD etc.) for
                                 which it will provide useful information.
                                 For example, HEXED will tell you what a byte
                                 in a file is used for in a PCX or GIF file.
                                 It will also edit two files at the same time,
                                 adding features like file comparing etc.
                                 You can search files for strings or binary
                                 arrays. You can cut and past using powerful
                                 block commands.

                                 Jorj (George) is a fast, pop-up, English
                                 language dictionary for use on IBM and
                                 compatible PCs. The program may be invoked
                                 with a DOS call or made memory-resident and
                                 popped-up at any time. A hard drive is the
                                 only requirement. This database has 53000
                                 words using 1.3 mb of disk. The dictionary
                                 look-up window displays definitions,
                                 syllabication and inflected forms.
                                 The dictionary uses a unique phonetic
                                 algorithm for searching its database.
                                 This allows you to locate words with greater
                                 ease as correct spelling is not required.
                                 Also, when Jorj is Hot-Keyed from a screen of
                                 text, a simple <ENT> key will look up the
                                 word which is at the cursor location so that
                                 a retyping of the word is unnecessary.
                                 In addition to word look-ups, the program
                                 also allows database searches for a given
                                 word or character string within definitions.
                                 This feature generates a list of all such
                                 entries, including their definitions.

                                 KeyBuf expands the keyboard buffer.
                                 This buffer is used by BIOS to store the
                                 unread keystrokes; the standard buffer is 32
                                 bytes long and can contain up to 16 key
                                 strokes (each one is a 2 bytes code). If you
                                 use to type a command or any other keyboard
                                 input before the BIOS (and thus the DOS) is
                                 ready to read it maybe you run out of buffer
                                 space. The result is a long acoustic signal
                                 and the loss of the extra characters you
                                 typed. KeyBuf will solve this problems for
                                 you.

                                 This is a subset of the EasyTool Utilities
                                 that contains all the utilities you need to
                                 run MAKEMENU.BAT.
                                 MAKEMENU Batch File
                                 To create a batch file that provides a menu
                                 of commands.
                                 Applications:
                                 Used to create a batch file that displays
                                 text within a box, centered on the screen.
                                 Used to create multi-level menu systems.
                                 Usage:
                                 MAKEMENU name-of-menu
                                 For example, "MAKEMENU CLEANUP" would let you
                                 create a menu batch file named "CLEANUP.BAT".
                                 MAKEMENU asks you questions to create a menu.
                                 The menu is a batch file that gives you
                                 choices (options) of what to do. When you
                                 press the appropriate key, the menu does what
                                 you chose. It then asks you to press any key
                                 to return to the main screen of choices.
                                 The EasyTool Utilities are a set of programs
                                 that make DOS more powerful and flexible.
                                 You can use them individually or combine them
                                 to invent your own commands.
                                 They are extentions to DOS's batch language.
                                 None are memory resident. In order to use
                                 them you need to know the concepts of
                                 subdirectories, paths, and wildcards.

                                 MakeName creates a batch file that sets a DOS
                                 variable to a string which represents the
                                 current date and time. You can call this from
                                 another batch file to set a unique file name.
                                 Useful for backup & export applications. Runs
                                 under DOS, Windows, OS/2, or Novell.

                                 key types. Input is one or more filespecs

                                 records/lines whose sort keys duplicate any

                                 (1) CUT is similar to the unix command with
                                 the same name. It removes columns from text
                                 files.
                                 (2) DETAB replaces TABs by SPACEs in text
                                 files, ENTAB performs the opposite task.
                                 (3) FMT is similar to the unix command fmt.
                                 It formats text files to a certain width.
                                 FMT supports left, right, and two-sided
                                 alignment. Many options control its
                                 behaviour.
                                 (4) HEAD displays the first lines of text
                                 files, like the unix command; TAIL does the
                                 same with the last lines.
                                 (5) LOCASE translates upper to lower case,
                                 UPCASE performs the opposite task. Both have
                                 a switch to ignore quoted strings, which is
                                 useful for program source files.
                                 (6) WC counts, like the unix command, lines,
                                 words, and characters of text files. An
                                 additional options lets WC compute the
                                 length of the longest line.
                                 All programs come with documentation and the

                                 sure if the device is available.
                                 Normally, when a DOS device is not present or
                                 a file is unavailable, DOS generates an

                                 requires user input. This is not good in

                                 ScanText is a program that counts the number
                                 of lines in a file or directory in which
                                 there are occurrences of a single word or a
                                 string of words.

                                 SCANCODE that lets you "fake" keystrokes from
                                 the keyboard when you first start a program.
                                 SCANCODE works similarly to other programs on
                                 the market, for example PC Magazine's
                                 KEY-FAKE, but there is one very important
                                 difference. These other programs use ASCII
                                 codes to stuff the Keyboard Buffer, while
                                 SCANCODE simulates keyboard hardware

                                 Trace is a system utility that produces a
                                 listing of the MS-DOS requests made by a
                                 process. It is a useful debugging tool that
                                 can be used on any executable program.
                                 Trace can also be used to provide a better
                                 understanding of the internal workings of
                                 many programs.

                                 A trivial little menu program in batch.
                                 Requires no external programs (e.g. CHOICE).
                                 However, I "cheated" by creating a small
                                 temporary COM file from inside the batch.
                                 This utility hardly qualifies as a "must
                                 have" for recent versions of DOS as a menu
                                 can be easily implemented with CHOICE, but
                                 it's an interesting technique.

                                 SHELL is basically a command interpreter like
                                 COMMAND.COM except with some extra
                                 functionality found in the UNIX shells and
                                 some other additions. It uses less than 20Kb
                                 of RAM which is not particularly large and
                                 can also be run from the High Memory Area
                                 (HMA) which saves any conventional RAM from

                                 UCOPY is designed to copy your files. It is
                                 particularly useful for backing up a whole
                                 tree of directories, since it can recreate or
                                 extend a directory tree at the destination,
                                 and will only copy new and newer (i.e. later
                                 time/date stamped) files. Another important
                                 use is to transfer files between two
                                 different machines, 'equalising' their data.

                                 wait until a certain time passes.
                                 The program continually displays the current
                                 time, which makes it easy to compare to the
                                 time set in WAITUNTL. WAITUNTL makes it easy
                                 to trigger a series of events based on time,
                                 such as downloading data at 6am and running a
                                 series of reports at 6:15 to have ready when
                                 you get in.
                                 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Works with DOS 1.1, 2.x,
                                 and 3.0.

                                 standard input, treats it as columnar data
                                 and rearranges selected columns according to
                                 a command-line template. This template can
                                 contain text. For instance:
                                 DIR | XCOLS File 1 was created at $
                                 will cast the output from the DIR command,
                                 replacing 1 with a file name (first column
                                 of data) and $ with the file creation time
                                 (last column of data) in the string given in

                                 XEQ - COM File Library and Command Executor
                                 This program allows COM files to be stored
                                 inside XEQ's code and executed by the
                                 command: XEQ command
                                 For example, if BEEP.COM has been added to
                                 XEQ then: XEQ BEEP will execute the BEEP
                                 program stored inside XEQ.
                                 The original BEEP.COM can be removed from the
                                 hard disk (onto a backup floppy).
                                 If the specified command is not in XEQ it is
                                 passed to the DOS for execution as if
                                 directly typed at the DOS prompt.
                                 The purpose is to prevent wasted hard-disk
                                 space by those pesky little COM files we
                                 don't seem to be able to do without.
                                 When hard disks are formatted they are given
                                 an allocation size (called a cluster size)
                                 and this is typically 2048 or 4096 bytes.
                                 So when you save a 7 byte COM file like
                                 BEEP.COM, it takes up a full cluster.
                                 By combining these COM files into this
                                 program or LIBRARY, several COM files can be
                                 stored in one file (the XEQ program itself)
                                 and still be accessed without this waste in
                                 hard disk space.

                                 ZeroIn v2.2 - replacement for CD command.
                                 It allows you to abbreviate directory names
                                 to just the first letter. If there is more
                                 than one match you can choose from a list.
                                 It's fantastic for Windows 95 long filenames
                                 (which it supports fully). You can change
                                 drives at the same time, and it doesn't care
                                 which kind of slash you use (forward or
                                 back). It does NOT use index files of any
                                 sort. It can perform multilevel matches eg
                                 \*\doc finds all second level doc
                                 directories. DOS 3.0+, 100k memory, 19k
