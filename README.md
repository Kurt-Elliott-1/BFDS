The original files are historical abandonware from the 1980s–1990s—most copyrights are long expired or unenforced.

Ben Rtchey Jr. passed away, I was windering why his site went down!

Grok AI recomended placing the files here, I added a File_id.diz to all the files that needed them, I HUGE thank you to Ben Richey
for building the old BFDS site and all the folks that created these uploads for all of us, I had a hard time deciding what to do
with all these files, I wish I could tun them without anything like DosBox...
I have some other DOS utilities that I will try to find, I think they were called PC Magazine Utlities, I dizzed them too!
I burned over 600 discs, i am lucky I catalog them so I can find the files.
The Files.bbs and index.html were wrote using my own scripts...

I love using AI to create videos! Right now I am installing AI software on my own computer, I am going to have to
buy a much more expensive video card for creating longer videos is what AI told me, but it will be worth it in the
long run, Please hit like, share, subscribe and enable notifications!
